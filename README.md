# CSC309 Winter 2015: Individual Project - MartinPetkov
Github repo for the Individual Project component of CSC309 Winter 2015 at UofT St. George.

This is a Django app, and the folder structure reflects this. It has one project called "ip" and one app called "ip_app".

Currently it can only be run locally and requires having django installed.

Instructions for running:
* Install Django if not already installed, using the command: "sudo pip install Django"
* In the ip_app directory, run the following command: "python manage.py runserver"
* In a browser, go to: "localhost:8000/ip_app"
